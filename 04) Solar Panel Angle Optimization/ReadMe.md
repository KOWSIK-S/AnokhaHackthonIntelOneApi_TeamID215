### Solar Panel Optimization Script

This script computes the optimal angle and elevation for positioning a solar panel to maximize solar radiation reception. The computation uses geographical and environmental parameters to estimate solar zenith angles and subsequent radiation values. The optimal values are determined through a nested loop approach, testing various angles and elevations to identify the configuration that yields the highest solar radiation.

## Functions:

compute_solar_declination(): Computes the solar declination based on the date.
compute_optimal_angle_elevation(opt): Determines the optimal angle and elevation for the solar panel placement.
## Optimization Process:
The optimal angle and elevation are determined by iterating over a range of angles (0 to 90 degrees) and elevations (0 to 90 degrees) to find the combination that maximizes solar radiation reception.
