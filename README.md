4. total_precipitation_sfc,
5. snowfall_amount_sfc,
6. total_cloud_cover_sfc,
7. high_cloud_cover_high_cld_lay,
8. medium_cloud_cover_mid_cld_lay,
9. low_cloud_cover_low_cld_lay,
10. shortwave_radiation_backwards_sfc,
11. wind_speed_10_m_above_gnd,
12. wind_direction_10_m_above_gnd,
13. wind_speed_80_m_above_gnd,
14. wind_direction_80_m_above_gnd,
15. wind_speed_900_mb,
