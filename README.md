## Solar Farm Pre-installment and Management System
The Solar Farm Pre-installment and Management System aims to optimize solar energy production, enhance efficiency, and ensure effective management. This comprehensive system encompasses various modules, each contributing to the overall success of solar farm installations.

# 1. Universal Power Prediction Model
Objective
Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting solar power output based on diverse parameters such as:
temperature_2_m_above_gnd	relative_humidity_2_m_above_gnd	mean_sea_level_pressure_MSL	total_precipitation_sfc	snowfall_amount_sfc	total_cloud_cover_sfc	high_cloud_cover_high_cld_lay	medium_cloud_cover_mid_cld_lay	low_cloud_cover_low_cld_lay	shortwave_radiation_backwards_sfc	wind_speed_10_m_above_gnd	wind_direction_10_m_above_gnd	wind_speed_80_m_above_gnd	wind_direction_80_m_above_gnd	wind_speed_900_mb	wind_direction_900_mb	wind_gust_10_m_above_gnd	angle_of_incidence	zenith	azimuth	generated_power_kw
# 2. Power Output Prediction
Objective
Forecast the expected power output based on yearly climate conditions at the clientâ€™s location.
# 3. Solar Panel Arrangement Optimization
Objective
Determine the maximum number of solar panels that can be installed on the specific site provided by the client.
# 4. Solar Panel Placement Angle
Objective
Optimize the angle for solar panel placement to maximize energy capture.
# 5. Dust Management
Objective
Address dust accumulation on solar panels to maintain peak efficiency.
