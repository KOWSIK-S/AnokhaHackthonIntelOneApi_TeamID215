Objective
Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting solar power output based on diverse parameters such as:

Temperature
Humidity
Wind speed
Installation height
Irradiation levels
Snowfall
Implementation
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather historical climate data from the client’s site.
Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
Model Selection and Training:
Explore regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forests) to build the prediction model.
Train the model using the collected data.
Validation and Performance Metrics:
Validate the model’s accuracy using test data.
Evaluate performance metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error)
