medium_cloud_cover_mid_cld_lay,	
low_cloud_cover_low_cld_lay,	
shortwave_radiation_backwards_sfc,	
wind_speed_10_m_above_gnd,	
wind_direction_10_m_above_gnd,	
wind_speed_80_m_above_gnd,	
wind_direction_80_m_above_gnd,	
wind_speed_900_mb, 
wind_direction_900_mb,	
wind_gust_10_m_above_gnd,	
angle_of_incidence,	
zenith,	azimuth

# Implementation
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather historical climate data from the client’s site.
Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
Model Selection and Training:
Explore regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forests) to build the prediction model.
Train the model using the collected data.
Validation and Performance Metrics:
Validate the model’s accuracy using test data.
Evaluate performance metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error)
