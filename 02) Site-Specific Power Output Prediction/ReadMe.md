### Objective
Forecast the expected power output based on yearly climate conditions at the clientâ€™s location.

Implementation
Historical Climate Data Integration:
Utilize the trained power prediction model.
Input yearly climate data (temperature, humidity, etc.) to estimate power generation.
Visualization and Reporting:
Generate visualizations (graphs, charts) to communicate power output predictions.
Provide insights into potential energy generation.
